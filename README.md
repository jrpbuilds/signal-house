# Signal House

Signal House is a local operator dashboard for Clawd.

It answers one blunt question:

> Is Clawd actually healthy, or just looking busy?

It is not a generic analytics dashboard. It is not a full observability platform. It is a focused workstream health screen for the person running OpenClaw day to day.

Signal House runs as a single long-running local daemon. It serves the dashboard, owns the local SQLite state, and keeps the dashboard warm by refreshing on its own schedule.

Signal House should make it obvious whether work is moving, where it is getting stuck, whether PRs are progressing, whether CI is behaving, and whether the system is collecting useful signal instead of noise.

## What Signal House tracks

Signal House is built around practical operator questions:

* Is work flowing?
* Which issues or PRs are stale?
* Are PRs getting merged?
* Is CI passing or failing?
* Are checks taking longer than expected?
* Are local sessions and tools being used?
* Did the last refresh succeed?
* Is the displayed data fresh, stale, partial, or missing?

If the dashboard cannot answer those questions quickly, it is not doing its job.

## Product scope

Signal House should stay small, sharp, and honest.

It should provide:

* a top-level health summary
* recent throughput trends
* cycle time and stale-work indicators
* a compact blocked/stale work queue
* recent CI and check outcomes
* recent OpenCode/OpenClaw session usage where available
* clear refresh status
* clear empty, loading, stale, partial, and error states

It should not become:

* a full observability platform
* a BI dashboard
* a forecasting tool
* a multi-team analytics suite
* a place where questionable metrics are dressed up as truth

If a metric is not available, Signal House should say that plainly. The right fix is to improve instrumentation, not fake confidence.

## Stack

Signal House uses two codebases in a single repo:

| Layer | Technology | Directory |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Dashboard UI | Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript | `frontend/` |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS 4, shadcn/ui | `frontend/` |
| State | Zustand | `frontend/` |
| Charts | ECharts | `frontend/` |
| Animation | Framer Motion | `frontend/` |
| Backend / DB | Node.js, TypeScript, better-sqlite3 | `server/` |
| Data collectors | GitHub API, git, OpenCode CLI | `server/lib/` |
| Database | SQLite | `.data/metrics.db` |

The backend modules (`server/db/`, `server/lib/`) are imported and called by the Next.js API routes at build time. Everything runs in a single process.

## Architecture

Signal House runs as a single long-running local Node process.

```text
Signal House daemon (one local process)
├── serves the Next.js dashboard UI on port 8999
├── exposes local API routes (GET /api/state, GET /api/diagnostics, POST /api/refresh)
├── imports backend modules from server/db and server/lib
├── owns the local SQLite database at .data/metrics.db
├── runs the background refresh loop on process startup (see note below)
├── rejects overlapping refreshes with a single in-process guard
└── exits cleanly, clearing the poller timer and in-memory state
```

The frontend reads from local API routes only. It does not call GitHub or local tools directly.

The intended shape is:

* one daemon process owns the local state and the refresh loop
* the server routes collect and cache metrics
* SQLite stores latest snapshots, daily rollups, refresh history, and source health
* the UI reads cached/local state
* the background poller keeps the dashboard warm on its own schedule
* manual refresh uses the same runner and the same concurrency guard as scheduled refresh
* failed refreshes do not wipe the last good data

### Data flow

```
OpenCode CLI ───► server/lib/sessions/collector ───┐
GitHub API   ───► server/lib/github/collector   ───┤
git local    ───► server/lib/git/collector      ───┼──► server/db/client.ts (SQLite)
OpenCode     ───► server/lib/opencode-daily     ───┘
                (orchestrated by server/lib/orchestrator/)
                                                         │
                                                         ▼
API routes (Next.js) ◄── getLatestState(), buildDashboardWindow(), buildDiagnostics()
    │
    ▼
Dashboard UI (React/Next.js) ◄── fetch('/api/state') via zustand store
```

### Background poller — current status

The poller logic lives in `server/plugins/poller.ts` as a Nitro plugin. In the current Next.js deployment, this plugin does **not** run automatically at startup. Manual refresh via `POST /api/refresh` works, but scheduled background polling is a pending gap. Once the API routes are ported (see issue track), the poller will be re-enabled as part of the Next.js app startup.

### Runtime contract

Signal House is daemon-first and single-instance. It assumes:

* exactly one long-running Signal House process per machine
* the process owns the local SQLite database file
* the background poller is started by the server process at startup, not by page or API requests
* scheduled refresh and manual refresh share the same runner and the same single-flight guard
* the poller timer and in-memory state are cleared on shutdown

Request-time collection, multi-instance, and serverless deployment models are not supported operating modes.

## Data sources

Signal House uses data that already exists:

* GitHub issues
* GitHub pull requests
* GitHub Actions and check runs
* local git history from configured repos
* local OpenCode/OpenClaw session metadata where available
* local logs where ingestion is simple enough to justify

Data sources should fail gracefully. A missing optional source should produce a clear warning, not take the whole dashboard down.

## Local development

### Prerequisites

* Node.js 18+
* npm
* OpenCode CLI, optional, for session usage metrics

### Install

Root dependencies (backend modules, shared types):

```bash
npm install
```

Frontend dependencies (Next.js, React, UI components):

```bash
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..
```

### Run the dev server

```bash
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

The frontend dev server runs on port 3000 by default. The production service uses port 8999.

Expected URLs:

| Location      | URL                         |
| ------------- | --------------------------- |
| Local machine | `http://localhost:3000`     |
| LAN device    | `http://<host-lan-ip>:3000` |

Find the host LAN IP:

```bash
# Linux
hostname -I | awk '{print $1}'

# macOS
ipconfig getifaddr en0
```

### Build for production

```bash
cd frontend && npm run build    # builds Next.js frontend (this is what runs in production)
```

The root `npm run build` builds the Nuxt/Nitro server output (`.output/server/index.mjs`). This is used for backend unit tests, not for the production service. The production service runs from the `frontend/` Next.js build.

## Configuration

The service reads from `~/.config/clawd/signal-house.env`. Local dev can use a `.env` file.

Runtime defaults are centralized in `server/lib/runtime-config.ts`, which is the source of truth for poller, dashboard, database refresh history, discovery, orchestrator, and session-collector defaults.

```bash
SECRET_HOUSE_GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here
SECRET_HOUSE_GITHUB_OWNER=your-org-or-user
SECRET_HOUSE_GITHUB_REPO=your-repo

SECRET_HOUSE_GIT_REPOS=/path/to/repo1,/path/to/repo2
SECRET_HOUSE_PROJECT_ROOTS=/path/to/workspace
SECRET_HOUSE_GIT_REPO_GLOBS=*
SECRET_HOUSE_GIT_DISCOVERY_MAX_DEPTH=3
SECRET_HOUSE_GIT_EXCLUDE=node_modules,dist

```

### GitHub configuration

| Variable                    | Purpose                                                |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `SECRET_HOUSE_GITHUB_TOKEN` | GitHub token used for issues, PRs, Actions, and checks |
| `SECRET_HOUSE_GITHUB_OWNER` | GitHub owner or organisation                           |
| `SECRET_HOUSE_GITHUB_REPO`  | GitHub repository name                                 |

### Local git configuration

| Variable                            | Purpose                                                         |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SECRET_HOUSE_GIT_REPOS`            | Comma-separated list of local repo paths to inspect             |
| `SECRET_HOUSE_PROJECT_ROOTS`        | Comma-separated root directories to auto-discover git repos in |
| `SECRET_HOUSE_GIT_REPO_GLOBS`       | Comma-separated glob patterns to filter discovered repo names   |
| `SECRET_HOUSE_GIT_DISCOVERY_MAX_DEPTH` | Maximum subdirectory depth for discovery (default `3`, `0` = no recursion) |
| `SECRET_HOUSE_GIT_EXCLUDE`          | Comma-separated directory names to skip during discovery        |

Explicit `SECRET_HOUSE_GIT_REPOS` paths and auto-discovered paths are merged. Duplicates are removed automatically. Invalid values (e.g. a non-numeric `MAX_DEPTH`) produce a warning and are ignored rather than crashing.

### OpenCode session configuration

| Variable                            | Purpose                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `SECRET_HOUSE_OPENCODE_BIN`         | Optional explicit path to the OpenCode binary |
| `SECRET_HOUSE_OPENCODE_COMMAND`     | Command fallback, usually `opencode`          |
| `SECRET_HOUSE_SESSIONS_PERIOD_DAYS` | Number of days to include in session metrics  |

The OpenCode collector runs:

```bash
opencode stats --days <period>
```

It parses the overview and tool usage output when available. If OpenCode is unavailable, Signal House should continue running and report the missing source clearly.

### Poller configuration

| Variable                                  | Purpose                                            | Default |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `SECRET_HOUSE_POLLER_ENABLED`             | Enables the background refresh loop                | `false` |
| `SECRET_HOUSE_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS`      | Poll interval in seconds (clamped 15–3600)         | `300`   |
| `SECRET_HOUSE_POLL_STARTUP_DELAY_SECONDS` | Delay before the first scheduled run               | `5`     |
| `SECRET_HOUSE_RUN_ON_STARTUP`             | Runs a refresh shortly after server startup        | `true`  |

The poller is owned by the Signal House daemon process. It is started at server boot, uses the same refresh runner as manual refresh, and stops cleanly when the daemon exits. Run exactly one Signal House daemon per machine. Do not run multiple poller-enabled instances against the same local state unless locking is explicitly designed for it.

### Database

| Variable  | Purpose                                                          | Default |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `DB_DIR`  | Directory for the SQLite database file (no `SECRET_HOUSE_` prefix) | `.data` |

Signal House may rebuild this local runtime database after schema changes. Existing local cache contents are not guaranteed to survive upgrades.

### Legacy env names

Each `SECRET_HOUSE_*` variable has a legacy fallback name for backward compatibility. The preferred name takes precedence when both are set. Legacy names:

`GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_OWNER`, `GITHUB_REPO`, `GIT_REPOS`, `GIT_REPO_ROOTS`, `GIT_REPO_GLOBS`, `GIT_REPO_MAX_DEPTH`, `GIT_REPO_EXCLUDES`, `OPENCODE_BIN`, `OPENCODE_COMMAND`, `SESSIONS_PERIOD_DAYS`, `METRICS_POLLER_ENABLED`, `METRICS_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS`, `METRICS_POLL_STARTUP_DELAY_SECONDS`, `METRICS_RUN_ON_STARTUP`

## Manual refresh

The dashboard includes a manual refresh action.

A manual refresh:

* uses the same refresh runner as the background poller
* runs through the same in-process concurrency guard as scheduled refresh
* keeps showing cached data while collection is running
* is rejected with `HTTP 409` if another refresh is already in progress (manual or scheduled)
* preserves the last good data if collection fails

GitHub rate limits still apply. If GitHub is slow, unreachable, or rate-limited, Signal House should show the cached state with a clear stale or partial-data warning.

## Background polling

When enabled, the Signal House daemon starts a guarded background poller at process startup.

The poller:

* is owned by the server process and started by `server/plugins/poller.ts`
* waits for the configured startup delay
* runs once on startup when configured to do so
* refreshes at the configured interval
* uses the same refresh runner as manual refresh
* uses the same in-process concurrency guard as manual refresh
* avoids overlapping runs (scheduled ticks skip while another refresh is in flight)
* records run status and source health
* does not crash the server when a collector fails
* stops cleanly when the daemon shuts down, clearing the timer and in-memory poller state

Manual refresh and scheduled refresh must not fork into separate logic. They share the same runner and the same concurrency guard. If a manual refresh is requested while the poller is mid-run, the manual endpoint responds with `409 Conflict`; if a scheduled tick fires while a manual refresh is running, the poller logs the skip and waits for the next interval.

> **Note:** The poller plugin uses Nitro server hooks and does not currently start as part of the Next.js deployment. Automatic background polling is a pending gap. See the Architecture section for status.

## API shape

The main dashboard endpoint is:

```text
GET /api/state
```

It returns the latest cached dashboard state, refresh metadata, and the rolling 28-day dashboard window.

A diagnostics endpoint provides detailed collector status:

```text
GET /api/diagnostics
```

A manual refresh is triggered via:

```text
POST /api/refresh
```

Returns HTTP 409 if a refresh is already in progress.

The `GET /api/state` response includes:

* latest cached snapshot
* refresh status
* stale-data status
* source health
* selected repo dashboard window (28 days of trend data)
* session usage summaries and model usage
* data coverage and warnings

The dashboard should be able to tell the difference between:

* fresh data
* stale data
* partial data
* no data yet
* refresh in progress
* last refresh failed but cached data exists

## Daily metrics

Signal House persists daily rollups in SQLite.

Each daily metric row is keyed by UTC day:

```text
YYYY-MM-DD
```

Daily rows are used for the rolling dashboard window and trend charts.

Behaviour:

* same-day refreshes overwrite the current day
* earlier days are preserved
* missing days remain explicit gaps
* the API returns chart days in ascending order
* gaps are not silently zero-filled

This matters because zero-filling missing days makes the dashboard lie.

## 28-day dashboard window

`GET /api/state` includes a rolling 28-day dashboard window.

The window contains:

* `startDay`
* `endDay`
* normalized `days`
* summary `cards`
* `coverage`
* warnings

Missing days are represented explicitly with:

```ts
{
  isGap: true,
  metrics: null
}
```

This lets charts and cards stay honest about incomplete data.

## Validation

Run the local verification commands before merging changes:

```bash
# Backend unit tests
npm test

# Frontend type check + build
cd frontend && npx tsc --noEmit && npm run build
```

> The root `npm run typecheck` runs `nuxt typecheck`, which depends on the old Nuxt config. Prefer `npx tsc --noEmit` from the `frontend/` directory for type checking.

Use the repo's actual scripts as the source of truth. If a script is missing or fails for environmental reasons, document that clearly.

## Running as a local service

Signal House is intended to run as a persistent local Node service on the machine that hosts Clawd. It can be bound to the LAN when needed, but LAN exposure should be treated as untrusted until optional protection is enabled.

A typical production run is:

```bash
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run build
npm run start -- --hostname 0.0.0.0 --port 8999
```

### Systemd user service

The project ships a user-level systemd unit at `~/.config/systemd/user/clawd-signal-house.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Clawd Signal House
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=/home/openclaw/projects/barkley-clawd/signal-house/frontend
EnvironmentFile=%h/.config/clawd/signal-house.env
Environment=NODE_ENV=production
Environment=PATH=/home/openclaw/.nvm/versions/node/v24.16.0/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
Environment=PORT=8999
Environment=HOST=0.0.0.0
ExecStart=/home/openclaw/.nvm/versions/node/v24.16.0/bin/npm run start -- --hostname 0.0.0.0 --port 8999
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

Manage it:

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user restart clawd-signal-house.service
systemctl --user status clawd-signal-house.service
journalctl --user -u clawd-signal-house.service -f
```

## Firewall note

If the dashboard should be available on the LAN, allow port `8999` and set `SECRET_HOUSE_ACCESS_PASSWORD` to enable the optional protection gate.

```bash
# firewalld
sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=8999/tcp --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload

# iptables
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8999 -j ACCEPT
```

## Design principles

Signal House should be:

* fast to read
* honest about uncertainty
* compact without hiding important failures
* boring operationally
* useful before it is pretty
* specific to Clawd/OpenClaw, not generic

Avoid:

* vanity metrics
* fake precision
* decorative charts
* dashboards that require interpretation archaeology
* abstractions added before the local workflow proves they are needed

## Optional LAN protection

By default, Signal House stays local-first and does not require any extra setup. If you bind it to the LAN or open the firewall, the app and local API become reachable from other devices on the network. That is useful for a trusted home or lab network, but it is not safe to treat as public access.

You can enable a lightweight shared-secret gate with two env vars:

```bash
SECRET_HOUSE_ACCESS_USERNAME=signal-house
SECRET_HOUSE_ACCESS_PASSWORD=choose-a-long-random-password
```

When enabled, requests must use HTTP Basic auth with those credentials. This protects the dashboard, API routes, and built-in server assets. It does not add users, sessions, roles, OAuth, or any multi-user account system.

What is protected:

* the dashboard pages
* `/api/state`
* `/api/diagnostics`
* `/api/refresh`

What is not protected:

* your network transport
* the host machine itself
* any reverse proxy or firewall you put in front of Signal House

## Current boundaries

Signal House does not try to solve everything.

It does not currently provide:

* alerting
* multi-user access control
* deployment tracking
* forecasting
* deep drill-down pages
* complete cross-repo analytics
* perfect session instrumentation
* long-term data warehouse storage

Those can come later if they become useful. For now, Signal House should stay small, local, and operationally sharp.

## Development rule

When adding a metric, ask:

> What decision does this help the operator make?

If the answer is unclear, do not add the metric yet.
